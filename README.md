# Kexter
Kext installer inspired by Kext Wizard design

First Xcode and Swift program ever from me so probably need help from you guys. Also I am new to GitHub and need sometime to get to any question or bug report.

This program is build in Xcode 10 and macOS 10.14 environment. Therefore I am not sure if it works for previous OS.

For now this app can only install kext and rebuild system permissions/cache. There are still many features missing from the original Kext Wizard. I will add more features in the future if possible. Once again, please don't expect too much from the one who hates and drops programming so much since Sophomore...
